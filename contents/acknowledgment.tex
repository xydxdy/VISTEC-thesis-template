I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. 

First and foremost, I am deeply thankful to my advisor, Dr. Jane Smith, for her invaluable guidance, constructive feedback, and constant encouragement. Her mentorship has been instrumental in shaping both the direction of this research and my development as a researcher.

I am also grateful to the members of the Computational Intelligence Lab for the stimulating discussions, technical assistance, and collaborative spirit that made every challenge more manageable and every success more rewarding.

Special thanks to my friends and colleagues, whose humor, advice, and moral support helped me maintain perspective during stressful times. 

Lastly, I owe my deepest appreciation to my family for their unwavering belief in me. Their love and patience provided the foundation that carried me through the ups and downs of graduate life.

This work would not have been possible without all of you.
