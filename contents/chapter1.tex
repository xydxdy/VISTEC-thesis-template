\section{Motivation}
\label{ch1:sec:motivation}
%========================
\begin{paragraph}
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology enabling direct communication between the human brain and external devices. This field holds immense potential for applications in assistive technologies, neurorehabilitation, and human-computer interaction, offering new hope for individuals with motor disabilities. However, designing effective BCIs remains challenging due to the inherent variability in brain signals, the presence of noise, and the limited availability of high-quality datasets.

Despite significant advancements in machine learning and signal processing, many current BCI systems struggle with generalization across users, sessions, and tasks. Addressing these challenges requires innovative approaches to improve robustness, adaptability, and scalability. This thesis is motivated by the need to develop methodologies that not only enhance the performance of EEG-based BCIs but also make them more reliable and practical for real-world deployment.
