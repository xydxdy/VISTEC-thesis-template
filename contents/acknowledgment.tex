I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. Completing this thesis has been a long and challenging endeavor, and it would not have been possible without the contributions, encouragement, and belief of many individuals around me.

First and foremost, I am deeply thankful to my advisor, Dr. Jane Smith, for her invaluable guidance, constructive feedback, and constant encouragement throughout the course of my studies. Her mentorship has been instrumental not only in shaping the direction of this research but also in refining my academic thinking, research methodology, and personal growth as a researcher. Her patience, insightful critiques, and continuous motivation have been pivotal in helping me navigate obstacles and stay focused on my goals. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn from her example of academic excellence, integrity, and dedication.

I am also profoundly grateful to the members of the Computational Intelligence Laboratory. The stimulating discussions, technical support, and spirit of collaboration fostered an environment that was both intellectually rigorous and welcoming. Countless brainstorming sessions, coding marathons, and shared frustrations over experimental hurdles made the journey all the more memorable. Their friendship and camaraderie turned the daily grind into a shared adventure, and I feel privileged to have worked alongside such talented individuals.

This thesis was made possible through the generous support of a full scholarship provided by the Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology, in collaboration with the PTT Group. Additional support from Siam Commercial Bank and Kasikornbank is also gratefully acknowledged. I would like to express my sincere appreciation for their contributions, which have been instrumental in enabling the completion of this work.

Special thanks are extended to my friends and colleagues, who provided not only technical advice and critical reading of drafts but also much-needed humor, encouragement, and moral support throughout the highs and lows of graduate school. Their constant presence, whether through late-night conversations, spontaneous breaks, or simply shared moments of laughter, was essential in maintaining balance and perspective during the most demanding times.

Most importantly, I owe my deepest appreciation to my family. Their unwavering love, patience, and belief in me have been the bedrock upon which I have built my academic career. Their sacrifices, understanding, and constant encouragement have been my greatest sources of strength, particularly during moments of doubt and exhaustion. This achievement is as much theirs as it is mine.

In closing, I am profoundly aware that this thesis represents not only my individual efforts but also the collective support, mentorship, and friendship of so many wonderful people. To each of you â€” thank you from the bottom of my heart. This accomplishment belongs to all of us.
