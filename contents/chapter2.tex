\section{Heading}

\begin{paragraph}
The chapter headings should be 14 points and any other titles should be in 12 points.  The text in the chapter body should be computer printed in 12 points Times New Roman font.
\end{paragraph}

\subsection{Sub-heading 1}

\begin{subparagraph}
Typing should be with a spacing of 1.5 between lines, including the List of References and Appendices.
\end{subparagraph}






\subsubsection{Sub-heading 2}

\begin{subsubparagraph}
Subheading 2 provides an example of items presented in an enumerated list.
\end{subsubparagraph}

\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\subsubparitemindent]
\item Enumerate One
\item Enumerate Two
\item Enumerate Three
\end{enumerate}





\section{Algorithm}

\begin{paragraph}
This is an example of \autoref{ch2:algo:my-algo}.
\end{paragraph}

\begin{algorithm}[h]

    \Require $n \geq 0$
    \Ensure $y = x^n$
    \State $y \gets 1$

    \State $N \gets n$
    \While{$N \neq 0$}
    \If{$N$ is even}
        \State $X \gets X \times X$
        \State $N \gets \frac{N}{2}$  \Comment{This is a comment}
    \ElsIf{$N$ is odd}
        \State $y \gets y \times X$
        \State $N \gets N - 1$

\end{algorithm}



\section{Equation} 

\begin{paragraph}
As an illustration of \LaTeX's mathematics formatting,
\autoref{ch2:eq:renyi} is the definition of {\em R\'enyi entropy} and \autoref{ch2:eq:total-loss} is the total loss function:
\end{paragraph}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EQUATION  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:eq:renyi}
H_{\alpha}(X) =
\frac{1}{1-\alpha}
\log \left(\sum_{x \in {\cal X}}P[X=x]^{\alpha} \right) .
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{ch2:eq:total-loss}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{total}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\{w_i\mathcal{L}_i\}. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\section{The table numbers}

\begin{paragraph}
The table numbers shall represent the chapter numbers. For example, the first table in the \autoref{chapter2} shall be ``\autoref{ch2:table:results} ...................'', etc. The number and title of a table (Table caption) should be placed ABOVE the table and aligned left. The word ``\autoref{ch2:table:results}'' is \textbf{bold} font except its caption. 
\end{paragraph}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TABLE BEGIN %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%%%%% Create LaTeX table from https://www.tablesgenerator.com/
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Classification performance.}
\label{ch2:table:results}

\input{tables/table1}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TABLE END %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  





\section{The figure numbers}

\begin{paragraph}
The figure numbers shall represent the chapter numbers. For example, the first figure in \autoref{chapter2} shall be ``\autoref{ch2:fig:model}'', etc. the number and title of a figure (Figure caption) should be placed BELOW the figure. For the figure caption which contains only 1 line, it should align CENTER throughout the thesis. For the figure caption which contains more than 1 line, it should align left throughout the thesis. The figure format should be pdf, png, jpg or \lstinline[language=C]!\chemfig! as \autoref{ch2:fig:mychemfig}
\end{paragraph}
